A simple benchmark for text processing comparing the speeds of Julia, Go, C, and Python

The C Code is taken from the [GloVE project](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), covered
under the Apache License, a copy of which is included in the C code.

The example corpus is the [text8](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip) from Matt Mahoney

To run the benchmarks, it should be enough to issue `make`.
